    # MCP tool for listing Docker networks.
    #
    # This tool provides functionality to list all Docker networks available on
    # the system, including built-in networks (bridge, host, none) and custom
    # user-defined networks. It returns comprehensive information about network
    # configuration, drivers, and connected containers.
    #
    # == Features
    #
    # - List all Docker networks on the system
    # - Comprehensive network metadata
    # - No configuration required
    # - Read-only operation
    # - Includes built-in and custom networks
    #
    # == Network Information Included
    #
    # The response typically includes:
    # - **Network ID**: Unique identifier for the network
    # - **Name**: Human-readable network name
    # - **Driver**: Network driver (bridge, host, overlay, etc.)
    # - **Scope**: Network scope (local, global, swarm)
    # - **IPAM**: IP Address Management configuration
    # - **Connected Containers**: Containers attached to the network
    # - **Options**: Driver-specific configuration options
    #
    # == Security Considerations
    #
    # This is a read-only operation that reveals network topology:
    # - Exposes network architecture and segmentation
    # - Shows container connectivity patterns
    # - May reveal internal network design
    # - Could aid in network reconnaissance
    #
    # While generally safe, consider access control:
    # - Limit exposure of network topology information
    # - Be cautious with sensitive network names
    # - Monitor for unauthorized network discovery
    # - Consider network isolation requirements
    #
    # == Example Usage
    #
    #   # List all networks
    #   ListNetworks.call(server_context: context)
    #
    # @example Usage in network management
    #   # Get available networks before container creation
    #   networks_response = ListNetworks.call(server_context: context)
    #   # Use network information to select appropriate networks
    #
    # @see CreateNetwork
    # @see RemoveNetwork
    # @see Docker::Network.all
