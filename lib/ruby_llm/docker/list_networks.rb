    # MCP tool for listing Docker networks.
    #
    # This tool provides comprehensive information about all Docker networks
    # configured on the system. It returns detailed network configuration
    # including IPAM settings, connected containers, and network drivers.
    #
    # == Features
    #
    # - Lists all Docker networks (built-in and custom)
    # - Provides detailed network configuration
    # - Shows IPAM (IP Address Management) settings
    # - Displays connected containers
    # - Includes driver information and options
    # - Reports network scope and capabilities
    #
    # == Security Considerations
    #
    # Network information can be sensitive as it reveals:
    # - **Network Topology**: Internal network architecture
    # - **IP Addressing**: Subnet configurations and ranges
    # - **Container Connectivity**: Service interconnections
    # - **Network Isolation**: Security boundary configurations
    #
    # Restrict access to this tool in production environments.
    #
    # == Return Format
    #
    # Returns an array of network objects with comprehensive metadata:
    # - Network names and IDs
    # - Driver types and configurations
    # - IPAM settings and subnet information
    # - Connected container details
    # - Network options and labels
    # - Scope and capability flags
    #
    # == Example Usage
    #
    #   networks = ListNetworks.call(server_context: context)
    #   networks.each do |network|
    #     puts "#{network['Name']}: #{network['Driver']}"
    #   end
    #
    # @see Docker::Network.all
    # @since 0.1.0
