    # MCP tool for listing Docker volumes.
    #
    # This tool provides functionality to list all Docker volumes on the system,
    # including both named volumes and anonymous volumes. It returns comprehensive
    # information about volume configuration, drivers, mount points, and usage.
    #
    # == Features
    #
    # - List all Docker volumes on the system
    # - Comprehensive volume metadata
    # - No configuration required
    # - Read-only operation
    # - Includes named and anonymous volumes
    #
    # == Volume Information Included
    #
    # The response typically includes:
    # - **Volume Name**: Unique identifier for the volume
    # - **Driver**: Volume driver (local, nfs, etc.)
    # - **Mountpoint**: Physical location on host filesystem
    # - **Labels**: User-defined metadata labels
    # - **Options**: Driver-specific configuration options
    # - **Scope**: Volume scope (local, global)
    # - **CreatedAt**: Volume creation timestamp
    #
    # == Volume Types
    #
    # Docker manages different types of volumes:
    # - **Named Volumes**: User-created persistent volumes
    # - **Anonymous Volumes**: Automatically created temporary volumes
    # - **Bind Mounts**: Direct host directory mounts (not shown in volume list)
    # - **tmpfs Mounts**: Memory-based temporary filesystems (not shown)
    #
    # == Security Considerations
    #
    # This is a read-only operation that reveals storage information:
    # - Exposes data storage architecture
    # - Shows volume naming patterns
    # - May reveal application data locations
    # - Could aid in data discovery attacks
    #
    # While generally safe, consider access control:
    # - Limit exposure of volume inventory
    # - Be cautious with sensitive volume names
    # - Monitor for unauthorized volume discovery
    # - Consider data classification implications
    #
    # == Example Usage
    #
    #   # List all volumes
    #   ListVolumes.call(server_context: context)
    #
    # @example Usage in data management
    #   # Get available volumes before container creation
    #   volumes_response = ListVolumes.call(server_context: context)
    #   # Use volume information to select appropriate storage
    #
    # @see CreateVolume
    # @see RemoveVolume

      # List all Docker volumes available on the system.
      #
      # This method retrieves information about all Docker volumes, including
      # both named volumes created by users and anonymous volumes created
      # automatically by containers. The information includes comprehensive
      # metadata for each volume.
