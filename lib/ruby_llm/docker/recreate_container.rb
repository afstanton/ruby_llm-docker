    # RubyLLM tool for recreating Docker containers with the same configuration.
    #
    # This tool provides a convenient way to recreate containers while preserving
    # their original configuration. It stops and removes the existing container,
    # then creates a new one with identical settings. This is useful for applying
    # image updates, clearing container state, or resolving container issues.
    #
    # == Features
    #
    # - Preserves complete container configuration
    # - Maintains original name and settings
    # - Handles running containers gracefully
    # - Restores running state after recreation
    # - Configurable stop timeout
    # - Comprehensive error handling
    #
    # == Process Overview
    #
    # 1. Retrieve existing container configuration
    # 2. Stop container gracefully (if running)
    # 3. Remove the old container
    # 4. Create new container with identical config
    # 5. Start new container (if original was running)
    #
    # == ⚠️ Data Loss Warning ⚠️
    #
    # **DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION - DATA LOSS POSSIBLE**
    #
    # This operation can cause permanent data loss:
    # - Container filesystem changes are lost
    # - Temporary data and logs are deleted
    # - Container state is reset completely
    # - Network connections are interrupted
    # - Anonymous volumes may be recreated empty
    #
    # == Security Considerations
    #
    # - Original configuration is preserved exactly
    # - Sensitive environment variables are maintained
    # - Port mappings and volume mounts are restored
    # - Network access patterns remain the same
    #
    # Ensure original configuration is still secure:
    # - Review exposed ports and volumes
    # - Validate environment variables
    # - Check image security updates
    # - Verify network policies
    #
    # == Example Usage
    #
    #   # Recreate with default timeout
    #   RecreateContainer.call(
    #     server_context: context,
    #     id: "web-server"
    #   )
    #
    #   # Recreate with longer stop timeout
    #   RecreateContainer.call(
    #     server_context: context,
    #     id: "database",
    #     timeout: 30
    #   )
