    # MCP tool for removing Docker volumes.
    #
    # This tool provides the ability to permanently delete Docker volumes from
    # the system. This is a destructive operation that will permanently delete
    # all data stored in the volume.
    #
    # == Features
    #
    # - Remove Docker volumes by name
    # - Force removal option for volumes in use
    # - Comprehensive error handling
    # - Dependency checking (prevents removal if containers are using the volume)
    # - Safe cleanup of storage resources
    #
    # == ⚠️ CRITICAL DATA LOSS WARNING ⚠️
    #
    # **DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION - PERMANENT DATA LOSS**
    #
    # This operation permanently and irreversibly deletes data:
    # - **ALL DATA** in the volume is deleted forever
    # - No recovery possible after deletion
    # - Applications may lose critical data
    # - Databases and persistent state are destroyed
    # - Configuration files and user data are lost
    # - Operation cannot be undone
    #
    # == Volume Dependencies
    #
    # Volumes may have active dependencies:
    # - **Running Containers**: Containers currently using the volume
    # - **Stopped Containers**: Containers that could be restarted
    # - **Application Data**: Critical application state and databases
    # - **User Data**: User-generated content and files
    #
    # == Security Considerations
    #
    # Volume removal has security implications:
    # - Sensitive data is not securely wiped
    # - Data may be recoverable from disk sectors
    # - Shared volumes may affect multiple applications
    # - Removal logs may reveal data existence
    #
    # Critical security measures:
    # - **Backup critical data** before removal
    # - Verify no containers depend on the volume
    # - Consider secure data wiping for sensitive volumes
    # - Audit volume removal operations
    # - Monitor for unauthorized volume deletions
    #
    # == Force Removal Risks
    #
    # Force removal bypasses safety checks:
    # - Removes volumes even if containers are using them
    # - Can cause immediate application failures
    # - May corrupt running applications
    # - Data loss occurs immediately
    #
    # == Example Usage
    #
    #   # Safe removal of unused volume
    #   RemoveVolume.call(
    #     server_context: context,
    #     name: "temp-data"
    #   )
    #
    #   # Force removal of volume in use (DANGEROUS)
    #   RemoveVolume.call(
    #     server_context: context,
    #     name: "stuck-volume",
    #     force: true
    #   )

      # contained within it. By default, it performs safety checks to prevent
      # removal of volumes with active container dependencies.

      # @raise [Docker::Error::NotFoundError] if volume doesn't exist

      #     name: "old-cache-data"
