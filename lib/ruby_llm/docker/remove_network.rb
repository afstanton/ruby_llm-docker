    # MCP tool for removing Docker networks.
    #
    # This tool provides the ability to permanently delete Docker networks from
    # the system. It safely removes custom networks while protecting built-in
    # system networks from accidental deletion.
    #
    # == Features
    #
    # - Remove custom Docker networks by ID or name
    # - Protection against removing built-in networks
    # - Comprehensive error handling
    # - Dependency checking (prevents removal if containers are connected)
    # - Safe cleanup of network resources
    #
    # == ⚠️ Service Disruption Warning ⚠️
    #
    # **NETWORK REMOVAL CAN DISRUPT SERVICES**
    #
    # Removing networks can cause immediate service disruption:
    # - Connected containers lose network connectivity
    # - Inter-container communication is broken
    # - Services may become unreachable
    # - Application functionality can be severely impacted
    # - Network-dependent processes may fail
    #
    # == Protected Networks
    #
    # Docker protects certain built-in networks from removal:
    # - **bridge**: Default bridge network
    # - **host**: Host networking
    # - **none**: No networking
    # - **System networks**: Docker-managed networks
    #
    # == Security Considerations
    #
    # Network removal affects security boundaries:
    # - Removes network isolation between containers
    # - May expose containers to unintended networks
    # - Could impact security segmentation strategies
    # - Affects network-based access controls
    #
    # Security implications:
    # - Ensure no critical containers depend on the network
    # - Verify alternative connectivity exists if needed
    # - Consider impact on security boundaries
    # - Monitor for unauthorized network modifications
    #
    # Best practices:
    # - Stop containers before removing their networks
    # - Verify network dependencies before removal
    # - Have rollback plans for critical networks
    # - Document network removal procedures
    # - Monitor network connectivity after removal
    #
    # == Example Usage
    #
    #   # Remove custom network
    #   RemoveNetwork.call(
    #     server_context: context,
    #     id: "app-network"
    #   )
    #
    #   # Remove by network ID
    #   RemoveNetwork.call(
    #     server_context: context,
    #     id: "abc123def456"
    #   )
