    # MCP tool for removing Docker networks.
    #
    # This tool provides the ability to delete Docker networks when they
    # are no longer needed. Network removal helps maintain clean network
    # configurations and prevents resource leaks.
    #
    # == Features
    #
    # - Remove networks by ID or name
    # - Validation of network existence
    # - Comprehensive error handling
    # - Prevention of removing networks in use
    # - Safe cleanup of network resources
    # - Network dependency checking
    #
    # == Security Considerations
    #
    # Network removal involves important considerations:
    # - **Service Disruption**: Removing active networks disconnects containers
    # - **Data Isolation**: Network removal can affect container communication
    # - **Resource Cleanup**: Improper removal can leave network artifacts
    # - **Container Dependencies**: Containers may fail without expected networks
    # - **Network Policies**: Removal affects security and access policies
    #
    # **Security Recommendations**:
    # - Verify no containers are connected before removal
    # - Check for dependent services and applications
    # - Document network removal in change logs
    # - Implement network lifecycle management
    # - Monitor for orphaned network resources
    # - Use network removal as part of cleanup procedures
    #
    # == Parameters
    #
    # - **id**: Network ID or name (required)
    #
    # == Example Usage
    #
    #   # Remove network by name
    #   response = RemoveNetwork.call(
    #     server_context: context,
    #     id: "app-network"
    #   )
    #
    #   # Remove network by ID
    #   response = RemoveNetwork.call(
    #     server_context: context,
    #     id: "abc123def456"
    #   )
    #
    #   # Clean up test networks
    #   response = RemoveNetwork.call(
    #     server_context: context,
    #     id: "test-isolated-network"
    #   )
