    # RubyLLM tool for starting existing Docker containers.
    #
    # This tool provides the ability to start Docker containers that have been
    # created but are currently stopped. It's the counterpart to StopContainer
    # and is commonly used after CreateContainer or when restarting stopped
    # containers.
    #
    # == Features
    #
    # - Start stopped containers by ID or name
    # - Simple and reliable container lifecycle management
    # - Comprehensive error handling
    # - Works with containers in any stopped state
    #
    # == Security Considerations
    #
    # Starting containers can have security implications:
    # - Containers resume with their original configuration
    # - Services become accessible on mapped ports
    # - Processes resume execution with previous privileges
    # - Network connections are re-established
    #
    # Ensure containers are properly configured before starting:
    # - Review port mappings and network exposure
    # - Verify volume mounts and file permissions
    # - Check environment variables for sensitive data
    # - Validate container image integrity
    #
    # == Example Usage
    #
    #   # Start container by name
    #   StartContainer.call(
    #     server_context: context,
    #     id: "web-server"
    #   )
    #
    #   # Start container by ID
    #   StartContainer.call(
    #     server_context: context,
    #     id: "a1b2c3d4e5f6"
    #   )

      # Start an existing Docker container.
      #
      # This method starts a container that is currently in a stopped state.
      # The container must already exist and be in a startable state. If the
      # container is already running, Docker will typically ignore the start
      # command without error.
      #
      # @param id [String] container ID (full or short) or container name
      # @param server_context [Object] RubyLLM context (unused but required)
      #
      # @return [RubyLLM::Tool::Response] start operation results
      #
      # @raise [Docker::Error::NotFoundError] if container doesn't exist
      # @raise [StandardError] for other start failures
      #
      # @example Start by container name
      #   response = StartContainer.call(
      #     server_context: context,
      #     id: "my-app-container"
      #   )
      #
      # @example Start by container ID
      #   response = StartContainer.call(
      #     server_context: context,
      #     id: "abc123def456"
