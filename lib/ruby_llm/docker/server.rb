    # MCP Server implementation for Docker management tools.
    #
    # The Server class initializes and configures a Model Context Protocol server
    # with all available Docker management tools. It serves as the main entry point
    # for Docker operations through the MCP interface.
    #
    # The server provides 22 comprehensive tools organized into four categories:
    # - Container Management: 10 tools for container lifecycle operations
    # - Image Management: 6 tools for Docker image operations
    # - Network Management: 3 tools for Docker network operations
    # - Volume Management: 3 tools for Docker volume operations
    #
    # == Security Considerations
    #
    # This server includes potentially dangerous tools that can:
    # - Execute arbitrary commands in containers (ExecContainer)
    # - Copy files between host and containers (CopyToContainer)
    # - Create, modify, and delete Docker resources
    #
    # Ensure proper security measures when exposing this server to external clients.
    #
    # == Example Usage
    #
    #   # Initialize the server
    #   server = DockerMCP::Server.new
    #
    #   # Access the underlying MCP server
    #   mcp_server = server.server
    #
    #   # The server automatically registers all available tools
    #
    # @see MCP::Server
    # @since 0.1.0
    class Server
      # The underlying MCP::Server instance.
      #
      # @return [MCP::Server] the configured MCP server with all Docker tools
      attr_reader :server

      # Initialize a new DockerMCP server with all available tools.
      #
      # Creates and configures an MCP::Server instance with all 22 Docker
      # management tools. The tools are automatically loaded and registered
      # with the server.
      #
      # Tools are registered in alphabetical order for consistency:
      # - BuildImage: Build Docker images from Dockerfiles
      # - CopyToContainer: Copy files/directories from host to container
      # - CreateContainer: Create new containers from images
      # - CreateNetwork: Create Docker networks
      # - CreateVolume: Create Docker volumes
      # - ExecContainer: Execute commands inside containers
      # - FetchContainerLogs: Retrieve container logs
      # - ListContainers: List all containers
      # - ListImages: List all images
      # - ListNetworks: List all networks
      # - ListVolumes: List all volumes
      # - PullImage: Pull images from registries
      # - PushImage: Push images to registries
      # - RecreateContainer: Recreate containers with same config
      # - RemoveContainer: Delete containers
      # - RemoveImage: Delete images
      # - RemoveNetwork: Delete networks
      # - RemoveVolume: Delete volumes
      # - RunContainer: Create and start containers
      # - StartContainer: Start existing containers
      # - StopContainer: Stop running containers
      # - TagImage: Tag images with new names
      #
      # @example Initialize server
      #   server = DockerMCP::Server.new
      #   puts server.server.tools.length # => 22
      #
      # @see MCP::Server#new
